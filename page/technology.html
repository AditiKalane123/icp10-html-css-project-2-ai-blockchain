            A decentralized ledger is a database that is shared, replicated, and
            synchronized across multiple nodes or computers in a distributed
            network. Unlike traditional ledgers managed by a central authority,
            a decentralized ledger operates without a central point of control.
            Every participant in the network maintains a copy of the ledger,
            ensuring transparency, security, and trust.

            A smart contract is a self-executing program stored on a blockchain,

            into lines of code. Once the predefined conditions are met, the
            contract automatically executes the specified actions without the
            need for intermediaries.

            loads, increased data volume, or more users without performance
            degradation or system failure.
