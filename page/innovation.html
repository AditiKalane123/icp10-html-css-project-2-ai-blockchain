    <h1>The Ultimate Research on Blockchain Development for Businesses - GoodFirms Survey</h1>
    <br>
  <p>  The blockchain is one of the biggest new developments to hit the technological industries in the past few years. This distributed ledger, connected among different users without relying on a single database, is said to be impossible to hack. Yet, technology has much more to offer. Thus, GoodFirms presents blockchain industry trends and research into how other industries can benefit from blockchain tech and what is it going to take in terms of resources to integrate blockchain in their commercial/industrial systems. </p>
  
  <p>Blockchain technology, that started off as a revolutionary innovation for financial and supply chain management sectors, has now taken a more humanitarian form of progress. The blockchain development is slowly paving its way in the government and non-profit sectors as they are highly risk-averse. As payments and money transfers are the largest use of blockchain tech, charities and nonprofits have come to accepting cryptocurrency as donations.</p>
  <p>The overhype created about the blockchain innovation is blocking the people to understand its real-world benefits through practical applications. It still remains a fashionable technology. But yes, newer businesses have started applying blockchain rather than just exploring it. They find it easier to adopt this tech.

 <br>
 <h2 class="survey">SURVEY OF BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES AND EXPERTS</h2>
 <br>
 <p>This survey was conducted among 50+ Blockchain Development Firms and experts to get in-depth knowledge of the blockchain scenario. Be it the latest trends, merits & limitations, cost & time taken, preferred tools & platforms for development and so on. Read on to get acknowledged of the statistical blockchain report made from the blockchain experts distinct opinions on different applications of blockchain technology.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;<h2>The Detailed Findings</h2>
 <br>
 <p>A set of mind-picked multiple choice questions were asked to the blockchain maestros in this blockchain research with reference to the dramatic disruptions that blockchain development has the potential to cause through its applications. What makes this blockchain survey valuable is its eccentricity focusing on numerous other angles other than cryptocurrency, which is highly needed for the businesses who want to take full-fledged advantage of blockchain innovation. Peruse through the graphically represented survey answers and get a clearer understanding of blockchain technology and its development through the blockchain research by GoodFirms below:
    <br>
    <h3 class="benefit">1. What are the main Blockchain benefits that can be leveraged by businesses?</h3>
    <br>
 </p>
 <img src="./../image/innovation-page-images/benefits of blockchain.png" height="900px" width="900px">
 <h4>The top four benefits underpinned by the professionals in this Blockchain research as illustrated in the above chart are decoded below:</h4>
 <p>Transparency and Immutability turned out to be victors earning the affirmation of 61.5% and 58.5% of this blockchain survey participants respectively. No matter what kind of transaction takes place using the Blockchain, the complete transaction history is shared with every peer included in the network. In fact, singular documentation is allotted with all the details in this distributed ledger system making transparency its peak-point among the advantages of Blockchain technology. That also means, that for changing a single transaction record would require the permission of the entire network. And thus, the data on blockchain is more accurate and consistent acing the quality of immutability.</p>
 <p>Reliability not staying much farther caught up with reasonable support of 40.8% of the survey takers. The very intention of Blockchain development is to be secure and stable, with a state of Byzantine fault tolerance. And such characteristics are rare particularly in a mobile application, that is in high demand among various businesses. The reliable nature of the blockchain implies that it is reasonable for a wide assortment of uses, from chronicle business and financial transaction to filling in as a platform for record stockpiling and everything in the middle. Any application that needs to store substantial volumes of information can conceivably profit from the reliability offered by the Blockchain technology.</p>
 <p>The adjacent blockchain benefit in the top four came out to be Decentralization as chosen by 33.7% of the Blockchain specialists. The one simple fact that the users donâ€™t have to put their trust in a central authority, is the game-changer! It eliminates the chances of your data getting sold to third parties and prevents single points of failure. That implies, a single node going down cannot bring down the whole system, so regardless of what number of users arrive and leave, your applications stay up and running.</p>
 <p>The alternate favorable advantages of the Blockchain technology incorporating 20.1% of the votes in the current Blockchain research are cost reduction, security, no intermediaries and automation.</p>
