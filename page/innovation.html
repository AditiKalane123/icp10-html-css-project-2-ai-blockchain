 </p>
 <img src="./../image/innovation-page-images/benefits of blockchain.png" height="900px" width="900px">
 <h4>The top four benefits underpinned by the professionals in this Blockchain research as illustrated in the above chart are decoded below:</h4>
 <p>Transparency and Immutability turned out to be victors earning the affirmation of 61.5% and 58.5% of this blockchain survey participants respectively. No matter what kind of transaction takes place using the Blockchain, the complete transaction history is shared with every peer included in the network. In fact, singular documentation is allotted with all the details in this distributed ledger system making transparency its peak-point among the advantages of Blockchain technology. That also means, that for changing a single transaction record would require the permission of the entire network. And thus, the data on blockchain is more accurate and consistent acing the quality of immutability.</p>
 <p>Reliability not staying much farther caught up with reasonable support of 40.8% of the survey takers. The very intention of Blockchain development is to be secure and stable, with a state of Byzantine fault tolerance. And such characteristics are rare particularly in a mobile application, that is in high demand among various businesses. The reliable nature of the blockchain implies that it is reasonable for a wide assortment of uses, from chronicle business and financial transaction to filling in as a platform for record stockpiling and everything in the middle. Any application that needs to store substantial volumes of information can conceivably profit from the reliability offered by the Blockchain technology.</p>
 <p>The adjacent blockchain benefit in the top four came out to be Decentralization as chosen by 33.7% of the Blockchain specialists. The one simple fact that the users donâ€™t have to put their trust in a central authority, is the game-changer! It eliminates the chances of your data getting sold to third parties and prevents single points of failure. That implies, a single node going down cannot bring down the whole system, so regardless of what number of users arrive and leave, your applications stay up and running.</p>
 <p>The alternate favorable advantages of the Blockchain technology incorporating 20.1% of the votes in the current Blockchain research are cost reduction, security, no intermediaries and automation.</p>
 <h3 class="benefit">2. Which are the top Industries Blockchain is likely to disrupt?</h3>
 <img src="./../image/innovation-page-images/top blockchain industries.png" >
 <p>It can be picked up from the above chart that the Finance, Supply Chain Management, and Government industries have been highly determined as the ones that are most likely to get disrupted by the Blockchain technology.</p>
 <p>The present structure of the banks relies on a third-party that maintains a central ledger of the transaction records as the banks do not trust each other. Whereas, in the Blockchain domain, each bank maintains its own copy of the ledger. Also, there is no chance of imposing changes in the records because of the transparency rendered by the Blockchain development. It ensures that every member involved knows that everybody is on the same page. There is no room for dispute or error.</p>
 <p>And this is the same for all industries integrating the Blockchain technology, regardless of who the stakeholder is - a bank or a product company or a government organization or a service firm and so on. Just have a look at the below diagrams to get a quick understanding of how blockchain is disrupting the current systems and enhancing the security.</p>
